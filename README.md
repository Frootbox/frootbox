# Frootbox

Frootbox is a content management system written in PHP: smart, simple and
AI-assisted, as an alternative to WordPress.

> **Status:** early development. Nothing here is usable yet.

## Repository

This monorepo contains the core, the official modules, the themes and the
tooling. Every package under `packages/` has its own `composer.json` and is
mirrored into a read-only repository.

| Path | Package |
|---|---|
| `packages/core` | `frootbox/core` |

## Development

Requirements: PHP 8.5 and Composer.

```bash
composer install
composer check
```

`composer check` runs PHP-CS-Fixer, PHPStan and PHPUnit. Single tools:
`composer cs`, `composer cs:fix`, `composer stan`, `composer test`.
